# The Written Analysis

# UFOs

## Overview of the analysis:

Dana's website and dynamic table are functioning OK, but she would want to give a more in-depth examination of UFO encounters by allowing viewers to select for numerous criteria at the same time. I'll add table filters for city, state, nation, and shape in addition to the date. This new project includes a technical analysis deliverable and a written report. You will be required to produce the following deliverables:Filter UFO sightings based on a variety of parameters. A written report on the UFO investigation. 

## Results:

Searches may be done by entering the table's search parameters into the associated filter.

Searches may be narrowed depending on the date, city, state, or nation of the incident, as well as the form of the UFO.

To find a certain field, enter the search parameters into the filtered areas. The filters themselves include an example of how data should be entered.

## Summary:

The most obvious drawback is that in order to return to the whole set of data in the table, you must erase your filter input.

The answer would be to provide a clear button that removed all inputted data from the filters, restoring the complete table data and removing the requirement for the user to manually erase the text in each filter. 

The other recomendation I would suggets is that I would allow for place name capitalization or entire state names to be provided, as many users may enter this data expecting it would work, but no data will be returned.
